Purpose:

The purpose of this script is to easily have a way to securely
run commands on large number of remote *nix systems.

Requirements:

- SSH
- Ideally pub/private keys 
- IP's or hostnames

Usage:

./distssh.sh <hostgroup> '<remote command(s)>'

Notes: 

- SSH keys are the best way to go here. Otherwise you will be typing in 
passwords in excess

- There is a bit of funkiness with quotes inside of quotes, you have been warned.
